    <title> Tyler The Creator</title>
    <h1> Bio</h1>
    <p> To me he hardly needs any form of introduction.
        <br /> However, bare with me as I fan girl over one of the greatest musicians we have witnessed since Micheal Jackson.
        <br /> He's been a success since he first surfaced into the music business back in 2008.
        <br /> He's more than an artist, its in the stage name "The Creator."
        <br /> He's infused alternative rap into 90s R&B
        <br /> Blended 90s R&B into a clothing label: le Fleur
        <br /> Which has woven into an empire with him at the helm
        <br /> of his own label: ODDFUTURE Records.
        <br /> He's a Grammy winner.
        <br /> If you dont know him, welcome to the party goblins and gremlins.
        <br /> Tyler, The Creator!
